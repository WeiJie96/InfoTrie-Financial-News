"Dec 24, 2017 06:49AM ET",Investing.com,Cryptocurrency News,Bitcoin Tumbles 15% As Cryptocurrency Drops Continue,"Investing.com – Bitcoin continued shedding value on Sunday, adding to losses after having entered a bear market on Thursday.
On a day of extreme volatility, typical for the largest digital currency by market cap, Bitcoin  plummeted 14.5%, or $2,036, on the Bitfinex exchange to trade at $12,000.00 by 6:54AM ET (11:54GMT). Prices have ranged from $14,706 to $11,777 in the last 24 hours.
The most popular cryptocurrency –which trades 24 hours a day, 7 days a week- hit a record high of $19,891.00 only last Sunday in the run up to CME’s launch of Bitcoin Futures .
Bitcoin officially entered a bear market, technically defined as a 20% plunge, on Thursday, with most market experts commenting that the alternative currency was long overdue for a correction.
Since that Sunday top, the alternative currency is currently down around 39.6% at the time of writing. However, Bitcoin has still rallied around 1,100% from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year and maintains gains of nearly 21% in December alone.
Unlike recently, cryptocurrency rivals were not benefitting from the selloff in the leading coin. Some observers suggested that investors were cashing in on stellar gains across the board as they closed their books ahead of the Christmas and New Year’s holidays.
At 6:57AM ET (11:57GMT), Ethereum , the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin, plummeted 13.2% to $582.50 and is off around 11.73% in the last 7 days.
After recovering on Saturday, Bitcoin-offshoot Bitcoin Cash  is declining once again on Sunday, plunging 15.03% to $2451.6. Despite the slide, the currency that was the result of the “fork” from the world’s largest digital currency on August 1 in a move that was designed to be able to process transactions more quickly at a lower cost held onto weekly gains of around 45%.
Similarly, Ripple  - designed for banks and global money transfers and with one of the more affordable price tags- fell 13.51% to $0.86 after having just having passed the historical milestone of $1 on Thursday. Still, the “low-cost” bitcoin alternative held gains in the last seven days of 25.1%."

""A case like the bankruptcy of Detroit would convince investors that the central government is really determined to dispel beliefs of an implicit guarantee for regional authorities.""
In a report published on Saturday, China's National Audit Office said the country should also dispel the ""illusion"" that the central government will pick up the bill for local government debt.

"Dec 25, 2017 03:47AM ET",Reuters,Economy,China needs Detroit-style bankruptcy as debt problems remain: central bank official,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China needs to let local governments take responsibility for their finances, including allowing bankruptcies, as part of an effort to defuse their debt risks, a central bank official wrote on Monday. 
Central government control of the scale of local government bonds should be eliminated, while responsibility to issue and repay bonds should be held by the city or county that will actually use the funds, Xu Zhong, head of the People's Bank of China's research bureau, wrote in a an editorial on the financial news website Yicai. 
""Eliminate central government control on the scale of local government bond issues, expand the scale of local government debt issues,"" Xu wrote. 
""Whether (bonds) can be issued, and at what price, must be examined and screened by the financial markets. There does not need to be worry about local governments chaotically issuing debt.""
China's top leadership decided at a meeting this week to take concrete measures to strengthen the regulation of local government debt next year as policymakers look to rein in a massive debt pile and reduce financial risks facing the economy.
The government needs to clarify responsibility as it explores a bankruptcy system for local governments, Xu wrote, as there is still an expectation that the central government will bail out those that run into fiscal problems. 
""China must have an example like the bankruptcy in Detroit. Only if we allow local state-owned firms and governments to go bankrupt will investors believe the central government will break the implicit guarantee,"" Xu wrote, adding that social services should be maintained. 
The United States city of Detroit filed the largest-ever municipal bankruptcy in July 2013, with $18 billion of debt. 
Xu also said that China should dismantle the hukou system of internal migration control, as free movement of people promoted equal access to public services and helped resolve imbalances in finances. 
In a report published on Saturday, China's National Audit Office said China should dispel the ""illusion"" that the central government will pick up the bill for local government debt.
But China should also increase the limit for local government debt as general government debt is primarily used for poverty relief spending, while also controlling spending on new projects. 
""Financial institutions must not provide financing to projects without a source of stable operating cash flow or that do not have compliant collateral,"" the office said. "
"Dec 25, 2017 07:28AM ET",Reuters,Politics,Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was sent gift-wrapped box of horse manure: reports,"(Reuters) - A gift-wrapped package addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's home in a posh Los Angeles neighborhood that was suspected of being a bomb was instead filled with horse manure, police told local media.
The package was found Saturday evening in a next-door neighbor's driveway in Bel Air, the Los Angeles Police Department told the Los Angeles Times and KNBC television, the NBC affiliate in Los Angeles. The package also included a Christmas card with negative comments about President Donald Trump and the new U.S. tax law signed by Trump last week.
Reuters could not reach LAPD officials for comment on Sunday.
An LAPD bomb squad X-rayed the package before opening it and found the horse manure inside, police told local media. Aerial footage from KNBC showed officers investigating a large box in wrapping paper, then dumping a large amount of what they later identified as the manure and opening the card that was included inside. 
Mnuchin, who KNBC said was not home when the package was discovered, is a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS ) executive and Hollywood film financier.
A road in Bel Air was closed for about two hours, KNBC reported.
The U.S. Secret Service is also investigating the incident, according to the TV station."
"Dec 24, 2017 11:30AM ET",Bloomberg,Cryptocurrency News,Cryptocurrencies Resume Selloff After One-Day Recovery Fizzles,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest cryptocurrencies resumed their decline on Sunday, failing to reverse a selloff that began when bitcoin’s unprecedented rally fell short of breaking above $20,000.
A rebound on Saturday fizzled in the afternoon and traders turned pessimistic again, driving bitcoin down 13 percent in the past 24 hours. The drop among the 10 largest digital coins, ranging up to 19 percent for iota , brings more end-of-year weakness to a market that just had its worst four-day tumble since 2015.
“The West is what’s causing this selloff,” said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at Tel Aviv-based online broker eToro, pointing to increased trading in dollars and less in yen. The recent cryptocurrency rally was so steep that investors were prone to take money off the table going into the Christmas holiday season, he said.
The retrenchment isn’t typical for cryptos, which often snap back after a few losing sessions. The last time bitcoin dropped for five successive weekdays was September and, before that, July. While the market has been volatile for most of this year, the rapid run-up has made the recent selloff sting more for digital coin enthusiasts.
Traders have knocked about $160 billion in market value off the biggest cryptocurrencies in about three days, according to CoinMarketCap data. The tumble coincided with several warnings in the past week from financial authorities about elevated risk in holding digital coins.
“The crypto market went to astronomical highs, so it’s got to come back to reality,” Greenspan said. “Something that goes up 150 percent in less than a month is probably going to have double-digit retracement.”
For a look at plans for ether, the ‘other’ cryptocurrency, listen here.
Bitcoin  was at $13,288 as of 4 p.m. London time. That’s almost one-third off its record high of $19,511, based on prices compiled by Bloomberg. Ethereum , the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market value, also dropped 13 percent in the past 24 hours, to $651.16, CoinMarketCap data show.
While “nascent blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are rapidly entering mainstream finance,” some of the second-generation digital coins have a better outlook than bitcoin, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone wrote in comments published Sunday. The whole group is akin to internet-based companies a few decades ago and exchange-traded funds more recently, he said.
“Bitcoin is the crypto benchmark, but not the best representation of the technology,” McGlone wrote. Altcoins “should continue to gain on bitcoin, which has flaws and where futures can be shorted,” he said.
Bitcoin’s record high was reached on Dec. 18 hours after CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME ) debuted futures  contracts, which some traders said would encourage short position-taking."
